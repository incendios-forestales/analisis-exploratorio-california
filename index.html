<h1>Introducción</h1>
<p>Los incendios forestales representan una de las amenazas medioambientales más críticas del siglo XXI. Además de destruir ecosistemas y biodiversidad, estos eventos comprometen la salud pública, la seguridad de las comunidades y la estabilidad económica, lo que evidencia la urgente necesidad de herramientas analíticas que permitan comprender y mitigar su impacto. Mediante técnicas de procesamiento y análisis espacial de datos geográficos, el presente estudio se enfoca en la incidencia de incendios forestales como una manifestación del cambio climático. A través del lenguaje de programación R, se desarrolló un sistema de visualización e interpretación geoespacial que integra datos vectoriales y ráster. El análisis se centró en el estado de California, Estados Unidos, una región particularmente vulnerable a eventos extremos asociados al calentamiento global.</p>
<p>Este documento presenta un análisis exploratorio de los datos de incendios forestales facilitados por el <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">Departamento de Silvicultura y Protección contra Incendios de California (CAL FIRE)</a>, a los cuales se les unieron datos de temperatura provenientes del <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/">Reanálisis atmosférico de quinta generación del ECMWF (ERA5)</a>.</p>
